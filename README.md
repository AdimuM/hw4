# Flutter Project - HW4

This Flutter project demonstrates a multi-screen application with network requests, SQLite database, and navigation. It consists of three screens:

1. **Welcome Screen:**
   - Displays a quick tutorial on the first launch.
   - Uses Shared Preferences to ensure the tutorial is only shown once.

2. **Second Screen:**
   - Fetches user information from a remote API (randomuser.me).
   - Allows users to fetch more users from the API.
   - Stores selected user data into a local SQLite database.

3. **Third Screen:**
   - Retrieves and displays user information from the SQLite database.
